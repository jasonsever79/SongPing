# SongPing



SongPing is a music-powered connection app designed to bring people closer through the emotion of a shared song.  

With a single tap, you choose a track on your phone — and it begins playing on someone else’s phone.  

Instant. Personal. Meaningful.



SongPing uses the user’s own Apple Music, Spotify, or YouTube accounts for playback — ensuring full legality and seamless integration.



## ❤️ Why SongPing Exists

Sometimes a text isn’t enough.  

Sometimes you want to send a feeling, not a message.



SongPing lets you do exactly that.



Pick a song → send the vibe → their phone starts playing it → a moment is shared.
